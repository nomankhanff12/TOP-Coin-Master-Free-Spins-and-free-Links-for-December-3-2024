Coin Master’s Game Systems
CM successfully takes the traditional slot machine experience (the heart of all gambling games), marries it with very light mid-core mechanics of base building, attacking and stealing from other players, and supports all this with a strong social loop over brilliant live-ops, a well balanced economy, great gameplay UX and a casual art style - all resulting in delivering a highly unique slots experience with significant market traction. Bizarre as all this may sound, this recipe works and the game can be very engaging and fun to play, even if you are not a social casino fan!

One would spin reels on a giant slot machine with spins generating different reel symbol combinations and betting more spins multiplying the reward, similar to traditional slots games
Each spin outcome can result in either gaining “Coins”, “Raiding”/“Attacking” to steal coins from other players’ bases or winning “Shields” to protect one’s own loot
By sinking all coins won in base upgrades, one progresses up the saga map and thereby unlocks more features and higher jackpots
Most definitely, “Spins” drive all core loop engagement. With 5 free spins being granted every 50 minutes, their availability is limited and hence they are an energy mechanic of sorts. As with all energy mechanics, game session length is tempered to protect players from burnout, while also driving monetisation and retention. But CM is also quite generous with giving out spin rewards through reel matches and events for example, and thereby strays away from the typical gameplay throttling impression energy mechanics usually have in other games.

Attacks and Raids - PvP Gameplay
One of the two possible PvP oriented spin results is “Attacking”. On hitting 3 attack reel symbols (hammers), one enters Attack mode and there is an immediate transition to a defending player’s base. Similar to viewing a base and choosing where to attack in mid-core Build & Battle games, one can choose which opponent structure to attack. A successful attack would yield a variable coin amount. It should be mentioned that unlike mid-core Build & Battle games, the attack experience in CM is a simple and quick one action affair. And given CM’s more casual target audience, keeping this experience light is definitely a prudent design choice.

the top of the slot machine, a Coin Master target is always displayed to the player and on some raid reel matches, it becomes possible to raid this featured target. Since this is usually a player with a lot of hoarded loot, it is equivalent to hitting a jackpot in traditional slot games - a major win motivator. But more interestingly, the existence of the Coin Master position inversely motivates players to sink their won coins quickly into building upgrades, so that they are not made more susceptible for raiding by being featured as Coin Master.

The second system auxiliary to Raids is the Pets collection mechanic, which lightly drives medium-long term monetisation and retention. Collected pets assist in stealing more loot during raids. Pets are acquired through completing card collections, and cards are acquired through chests that can either be randomly found during a raid or purchased directly from the store.

Base Building and Saga Progression
The base and saga map make up the progression backbone of the entire game. On a certain village base, one uses coin winnings to build and upgrade various buildings. Once all the buildings of the village base have been upgraded to their maximum levels, the player moves up the saga map to a different village level, inherits a new base, and continues to build and upgrade new buildings. Most definitely, higher village levels unlock newer features and allow higher coin payouts from various slot reel matches. Each village base also has different themes for both the slot machine and base buildings, which become more exquisite and animated as one moves up saga map.

One could argue that the changing of themes along the saga map is Moon Active’s slick solution to retain the same feeling that one gets from playing across different slot machines in the lobbies of traditional slots games - without all the lobby-style cognitive load and DLC woes. At the same time, since nothing but the theme and potential payout amounts change, it cannot be considered as an absolutely new slot machine and therefore maybe a lost opportunity to slightly vary gameplay and keep things even more fresh as a player progresses deeper.
